## Git Commands and Concepts

### 1. Checking Git Version

- **Command:** `git --version`
- **Explanation:** This command checks the version of Git installed on your system. It's useful to ensure you have Git installed and to verify you're using an up-to-date version.
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
---
### 2. Checking Repository Status

- **Command:** `git status`
- **Explanation:** This command shows the current status of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
---
### 3. Initializing a Repository

- **Command:** `git init`
- **Explanation:** Run this command one time per folder to turn that folder into a Git repository. This command sets up the necessary files and directories that Git uses to track changes.
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
---
### 4. The Hidden .git Folder

- **Explanation:** When you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden folder named `.git` inside your project directory. This folder contains all the configuration files and data necessary for version control.
  - **Example:** `.git` is like the brain of your Git repository; it stores all the history and information about your commits and branches.
---
### 5. Commits: Like Checkpoints

- **Explanation:** A commit in Git is like saving a game. Each commit records a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous commit, just like restarting from the last checkpoint in a game.
  - **Example:** If you save your game at level 5, you can always go back to level 5 if you mess up at level 6.
---
### 6. Basic Workflow in Git

- **Workflow Overview:**
  1. **Working Directory:** This is your initialized folder where you make changes to files.
  2. **Staging Area:** When you’re ready to save a snapshot of your changes, you add them to the staging area using `git add`.
  3. **Repository:** After staging, you commit your changes to the repository with `git commit`. This saves your snapshot.
  4. **Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub):** Finally, you push your commits from your local repository to a remote repository like GitHub using `git push`.

  - **Illustration:**
    ```
    Working Dir[initialized folder] ---> git add ---> Staging Area ---> git commit ---> Repo ---> git push ---> GitHub
    ```

  - **Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Add changes to the staging area
    git add <file_name>
    git add .  # Adds all changes

    # Commit changes to the repository
    git commit -m "Commit message"

    # Push changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
    git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
    ```

  - **Example Workflow:**
    1. **Working Directory:** Make changes to `file1.txt`.
    2. **Staging Area:** `git add file1.txt`
    3. **Repository:** `git commit -m "Add file1.txt"`
    4. **Remote Repository:** `git push origin main`


---
### 7. Viewing the Commit Log

- **Command:** `git log`
- **Explanation:** This command shows the commit history of the current branch. It lists all the commits in reverse chronological order (most recent commits first).
  ```bash
  git log
  ```
---
### 8. Viewing a Single Commit

- **Command:** `git log -1`
- **Explanation:** This command shows only the most recent commit. It’s useful when you just need to see the latest changes.
  ```bash
  git log -1
  ```
---
### 9. Viewing a Simplified Commit Log

- **Command:** `git log --oneline`
- **Explanation:** This command shows a condensed version of the commit history. Each commit is displayed on a single line with the commit hash and commit message. It’s handy for getting a quick overview of the commit history.
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```
---
## Atomic Commits

### 10. Atomic Commits

- **Explanation:** An atomic commit is a commit that contains changes related to a single task or issue. The idea is to keep each commit focused and small, making it easier to understand and manage the history of changes. Each atomic commit should be self-contained, meaning it includes everything necessary for that change to work and nothing more.
  - **Benefits:**
    - **Easier to Understand:** Each commit addresses a specific task or fix, making the commit history easier to read.
    - **Simpler Reverts:** If a commit causes issues, it can be reverted without affecting unrelated changes.
    - **Better Collaboration:** Team members can review and understand changes more easily.

- **Example:** If you are working on adding a new feature and fixing a bug, you should make separate commits for the feature and the bug fix. This way, each commit is focused on a single change.
  ```bash
  # Example of creating atomic commits
  git add feature_file.py
  git commit -m "Add new feature X"

  git add bugfix_file.py
  git commit -m "Fix bug Y"
  ```
---
### 11. Setting Username and Email

- **Command:** `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets your username for all Git repositories on your computer. It’s essential for identifying who made the changes in the commit history.
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```

- **Command:** `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets your email address for all Git repositories on your computer. It’s used in conjunction with your username to attribute commits.
  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  ```
---
### 12. Setting Default Text Editor

- **Command:** `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets Visual Studio Code as the default text editor for Git. The `--wait` option tells Git to wait for the editor to close before proceeding. You can replace `"code --wait"` with your preferred text editor command.
  ```bash
  git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
  ```
---
## Git Ignore and Configuration Files

### 13. Using .gitignore

- **Explanation:** The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build outputs, or sensitive information from being tracked.
  - **Example:** Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository and add patterns for files you want to ignore.
  ```gitignore
  # Ignore all .log files
  *.log

  # Ignore node_modules directory
  node_modules/

  # Ignore all files in the temp directory
  temp/
  ```
---
### 14. .gitconfig File

- **Explanation:** The `.gitconfig` file in your root directory (or home directory) stores global Git configuration settings. These settings apply to all repositories on your machine unless overridden by a repository-specific configuration.
  - **Location:** Typically found at `~/.gitconfig` on Unix systems and `C:\Users\YourName\.gitconfig` on Windows.
---
## Commit Details

### 15. Commit Behind the Scenes

- **Explanation:** Each commit in Git has a unique hash (ID), and it stores information about the commit, including the author, date, commit message, and a pointer to its parent commit.
  - **Diagram:**
    ```plaintext
    +------------------------+
    | Commit Hash: def456    |
    | Parent Hash: ghi789    |
    | Author: Your Name      |
    | Date: YYYY-MM-DD       |
    | Message: "1st commit"  |
    +------------------------+
                |
                v
    +------------------------+
    | Commit Hash: abc123    |
    | Parent Hash: def456    |
    | Author: Your Name      |
    | Date: YYYY-MM-DD       |
    | Message: "@nd commit"  |
    +------------------------+
    ```
---
### 16. Viewing All Commits

- **Explanation:** All commit messages and details are stored in the `.git` directory within your repository. Specifically, you can see all the commit objects in the `.git/objects` directory, but a more user-friendly way is to use `git log` or look into the `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` file for the most recent commit message.
  - **Commands to View Commits:**
    ```bash
    git log  # View commit history
    cat .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG  # View the message of the most recent commit
    ```


---
### 17. What's HEAD?

- **Explanation:** In Git, `HEAD` is a pointer that refers to the current branch reference, typically the latest commit in your working directory. When you make a commit, `HEAD` moves to the new commit.
  - **Example:** If you're on the `master` branch, `HEAD` points to the latest commit in `master`.
---
## Working with Branches

### 18. Git Branches (Like Alternate Timelines)

- **Explanation:** Branches in Git allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on different features or fixes in parallel. Think of branches as alternate timelines in a project where changes can happen independently.
---
### 19. Listing Branches

- **Command:** `git branch`
- **Explanation:** Lists all the local branches in your repository. The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

- **Command:** `git branch -a`
- **Explanation:** Lists all branches, both local and remote.
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```

- **File System Path:** `.git/refs/heads`
- **Explanation:** This directory contains references to all local branches.
---
### 20. Creating and Switching Branches

- **Command:** `git branch {branch-name}`
- **Explanation:** Creates a new branch named `{branch-name}`.
  ```bash
  git branch new-feature
  ```

- **Command:** `git checkout {branch-name}` or `git switch {branch-name}`
- **Explanation:** Switches to the branch named `{branch-name}`.
  ```bash
  git checkout new-feature
  # or
  git switch new-feature
  ```

- **Command:** `git checkout -b {branch-name}` or `git switch -c {branch-name}`
- **Explanation:** Creates and switches to a new branch named `{branch-name}` in one step.
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-feature
  # or
  git switch -c new-feature
  ```

- **Command:** `git branch -d {branch-name}`
- **Explanation:** Deletes the branch named `{branch-name}`.
  ```bash
  git branch -d new-feature
  ```
---
### 21. Checkout vs Switch

- **Explanation:** `git checkout` and `git switch` are both used to switch branches, but `git switch` is a newer and simpler command designed specifically for switching branches. `git checkout` is more versatile but also more complex because it can be used for other purposes, like checking out specific files or commits.
  - **Checkout:** Versatile, used for switching branches, files, and commits.
  - **Switch:** Simplified, used only for switching branches.
---
### Important Tips

- **Always commit before checking out new branches:** This ensures your work is saved before switching branches.
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Save changes before switching branches"
  ```

- **Check the current branch:**
  - **Command:** `cat .git/HEAD`
  - **Explanation:** This file shows the current branch that `HEAD` is pointing to.
  ```bash
  cat .git/HEAD
  ```
---
## Merging Branches

### 22. Fast Forward Merge

- **Explanation:** A fast forward merge happens when the branch you’re merging into has not diverged from the branch you’re merging. Git simply moves the pointer forward.
  ```bash
  git merge feature-branch
  ```
---
### 23. Not Fast Forward Merge

- **Explanation:** When the branches have diverged, Git performs a three-way merge, creating a new commit that combines changes from both branches.
  ```bash
  git merge feature-branch
  ```
---
### 24. Handling Conflicts

- **Explanation:** Merge conflicts occur when changes in the two branches conflict and Git cannot automatically resolve them. Using a code editor like Visual Studio Code with merge support can help you see and resolve conflicts more easily.
  - **Example:** During a merge conflict, open the conflicting files in VS Code to see the differences and resolve the conflicts manually.
  ```bash
  # After merge conflict
  code .
  ```
    - **Example Conflict:**
  ```plaintext
  <<<< HEAD
  Current branch's content
  ====
  New branch's content
  >>>> newBranch
---


## Viewing Differences

### 25. git diff

- **Command:** `git diff`
- **Explanation:** Shows the changes between your working directory and the staging area. It helps you see what changes are being tracked by Git.
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
---
### 26. git diff --staged

- **Command:** `git diff --staged`
- **Explanation:** Shows the changes between the staging area and the last commit. It helps you see what changes will be included in the next commit.
  ```bash
  git diff --staged
  ```

- **Note:** The `--` and `++` symbols are not for adding or deleting code. They are just symbols indicating changes between the past and the current version of the file.
  ```plaintext
  - line removed
  + line added
  ```
---
### 27. git diff commit1..commit2

- **Command:** `git diff commit1..commit2`
- **Explanation:** Shows the differences between two specific commits. Replace `commit1` and `commit2` with the actual commit hashes.
  ```bash
  git diff abc123..def456
  ```
---
### 28. git diff branchOne..branchTwo

- **Command:** `git diff branchOne..branchTwo`
- **Explanation:** Shows the differences between two branches. Replace `branchOne` and `branchTwo` with the actual branch names.
  ```bash
  git diff feature-branch..main
  ```
---
## Stashing Changes

### 29. git stash

- **Explanation:** Stashing is like placing your code on a shelf where you can keep it in reserve. It's useful when you have conflicting changes and need to switch branches without committing.
  - **Command:** `git stash`
  - **Explanation:** Saves your uncommitted changes and cleans your working directory.
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```
---
### 30. git stash pop

- **Command:** `git stash pop`
- **Explanation:** Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.
  ```bash
  git stash pop
  ```
---
### 31. git stash apply

- **Command:** `git stash apply`
- **Explanation:** Applies the most recent stash without removing it from the stash list.
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

- **Command:** `git stash apply stash@{0}`
- **Explanation:** Applies a specific stash from the stash list.
  ```bash
  git stash apply stash@{0}
  ```
---
### 32. git stash list

- **Command:** `git stash list`
- **Explanation:** Lists all stashes that you have saved.
  ```bash
  git stash list
  ```
---
## More Commonly Used Commands
---
### 33. git checkout hash

- **Command:** `git checkout hash`
- **Explanation:** Checks out a specific commit hash, detaching `HEAD` and allowing you to create a new branch from that state.
  ```bash
  git checkout abc123
  ```
---
### 34. git switch main

- **Command:** `git switch main`
- **Explanation:** Reattaches `HEAD` to the main branch.
  ```bash
  git switch main
  ```
---
### 35. git checkout HEAD~2

- **Command:** `git checkout HEAD~2`
- **Explanation:** Checks out the state of the repository from two commits prior to the current commit.
  ```bash
  git checkout HEAD~2
  ```
---
### 36. git restore {file-name}

- **Command:** `git restore {file-name}`
- **Explanation:** Restores the specified file to the state it was in at the last commit.
  ```bash
  git restore file.txt
  ```
---



## Rebasing

### 37. Rebase: Rewriting History

- **Explanation:** Rebasing is a way to rewrite commit history. It can be used as an alternative to merging and is often used to clean up a series of commits before integrating them into a main branch.

### 38. Alternative to Merging

- **Explanation:** Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. This results in a linear project history.
  ```plaintext
    Before Rebase:        After Rebase:
    main                  main
    |                     |
    A---B---C             A---B---C---D'---E'
          \               
          D---E             

  ```

### 39. Cleanup Tool

- **Explanation:** Rebasing can be used to clean up commits before integrating them into the main branch. It allows you to edit, combine, or remove commits.
  ```bash
  # Interactive rebase to clean up commits
  git rebase -i HEAD~3
  ```

### 40. Caution with Rebasing

- **Important:** Never run `git rebase` from the `main` or `master` branch. Always run it from a side branch to avoid rewriting the published commit history, which can cause problems for collaborators.
  ```plaintext
  # Correct workflow
  git checkout sidebranch
  git rebase main
  ```

### 41. Rebasing onto main or master

- **Command:** `git rebase main` or `git rebase master`
- **Explanation:** When you are on your side branch and want to incorporate the latest changes from the `main` or `master` branch, you can rebase your side branch onto `main` or `master`. This effectively applies your changes on top of the latest commits from `main` or `master`.
  ```bash
  # Switch to your side branch
  git checkout sidebranch

  # Rebase onto main or master
  git rebase main
  # or
  git rebase master
  ```

- **Example Workflow:**
  1. **Ensure you are on your side branch:**
     ```bash
     git checkout sidebranch
     ```

  2. **Rebase your side branch onto `main` or `master`:**
     ```bash
     git rebase main
     # or
     git rebase master
     ```

  3. **Resolve any conflicts that arise during the rebase process.**
     ```bash
     # Resolve conflicts in your editor
     git add resolved_file.txt
     git rebase --continue
     ```

  4. **Continue the rebase process until it completes.**

## Working with Remotes

### 42. git remote

- **Command:** `git remote`
- **Explanation:** Lists all the remote repositories that are currently connected to your local repository.
  ```bash
  git remote
  ```

### 43. Adding a Remote

- **Command:** `git remote add {name} {url}`
- **Explanation:** Adds a new remote repository with the specified name and URL.
  ```bash
  git remote add myremote https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

### 44. Adding an Origin Remote

- **Command:** `git remote add origin {url}`
- **Explanation:** Adds a remote repository named `origin`. By convention, `origin` is used to refer to the main remote repository.
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

### 45. Renaming a Remote

- **Command:** `git remote rename oldname newname`
- **Explanation:** Renames an existing remote from `oldname` to `newname`.
  ```bash
  git remote rename myremote newremote
  ```

### 46. Removing a Remote

- **Command:** `git remote remove {name}`
- **Explanation:** Removes the remote repository with the specified name.
  ```bash
  git remote remove myremote
  ```

## Pushing Changes

### 47. Pushing to a Remote

- **Command:** `git push {remote} {branch}`
- **Explanation:** Pushes the specified branch to the given remote repository.
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

### 48. Pushing to Origin's Master Branch

- **Command:** `git push origin master`
- **Explanation:** Pushes the `master` branch to the remote repository named `origin`.
  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```

### 49. Pushing with Tracking

- **Command:** `git push -u origin main`
- **Explanation:** Pushes the `main` branch to `origin` and sets up tracking so that future `git push` and `git pull` commands will automatically use this remote and branch.
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### 50. Pushing Local Branch to Remote Branch

- **Command:** `git push {remote} local-branch:remote-branch`
- **Explanation:** Pushes the local branch to a branch with a different name on the remote repository.
  ```bash
  git push origin feature-branch:main-feature
  ```
---


## Cloning Repositories

### 51. git clone

- **Command:** `git clone {url}`
- **Explanation:** Clones a remote repository to your local machine, creating a copy of the repository with all its history. The new directory created will have the same name as the repository.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

- **Example:** Cloning a repository named `example-repo` from GitHub.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/user/example-repo.git
  ```

## Fetching and Pulling Changes

### 52. git fetch

- **Command:** `git fetch`
- **Explanation:** Fetches updates from the remote repository, bringing the latest commits and branches without merging them into your working directory. This updates your remote-tracking branches.
  ```bash
  git fetch
  ```

- **Example:** Fetching updates from the remote repository named `origin`.
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  ```

### 53. git pull

- **Command:** `git pull`
- **Explanation:** Fetches updates from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch. This is essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.
  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

- **Example:** Pulling updates from the remote repository named `origin` into the current branch.
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

### Comparison of git fetch and git pull

- **git fetch:**
  - Fetches updates from the remote repository.
  - Updates remote-tracking branches.
  - Does not merge changes into your current branch.
  - Useful when you want to review changes before merging.

- **git pull:**
  - Fetches updates from the remote repository.
  - Merges updates into your current branch.
  - Useful for quickly incorporating remote changes into your local branch.

## Example Workflow for Collaboration

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/example-repo.git
   ```

2. **Fetch updates from the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Review fetched changes (optional):**
   ```bash
   git log origin/main
   ```

4. **Pull updates into your current branch:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
