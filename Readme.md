## Git Commands and Concepts

### 1. Checking Git Version

- **Command:** `git --version`
- **Explanation:** This command checks the version of Git installed on your system. It's useful to ensure you have Git installed and to verify you're using an up-to-date version.
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

### 2. Checking Repository Status

- **Command:** `git status`
- **Explanation:** This command shows the current status of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

### 3. Initializing a Repository

- **Command:** `git init`
- **Explanation:** Run this command one time per folder to turn that folder into a Git repository. This command sets up the necessary files and directories that Git uses to track changes.
  ```bash
  git init
  ```

### 4. The Hidden .git Folder

- **Explanation:** When you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden folder named `.git` inside your project directory. This folder contains all the configuration files and data necessary for version control.
  - **Example:** `.git` is like the brain of your Git repository; it stores all the history and information about your commits and branches.

### 5. Commits: Like Checkpoints

- **Explanation:** A commit in Git is like saving a game. Each commit records a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous commit, just like restarting from the last checkpoint in a game.
  - **Example:** If you save your game at level 5, you can always go back to level 5 if you mess up at level 6.

### 6. Basic Workflow in Git

- **Workflow Overview:**
  1. **Working Directory:** This is your initialized folder where you make changes to files.
  2. **Staging Area:** When you’re ready to save a snapshot of your changes, you add them to the staging area using `git add`.
  3. **Repository:** After staging, you commit your changes to the repository with `git commit`. This saves your snapshot.
  4. **Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub):** Finally, you push your commits from your local repository to a remote repository like GitHub using `git push`.

  - **Illustration:**
    ```
    Working Dir[initialized folder] ---> git add ---> Staging Area ---> git commit ---> Repo ---> git push ---> GitHub
    ```

  - **Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Add changes to the staging area
    git add <file_name>
    git add .  # Adds all changes

    # Commit changes to the repository
    git commit -m "Commit message"

    # Push changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
    git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
    ```

  - **Example Workflow:**
    1. **Working Directory:** Make changes to `file1.txt`.
    2. **Staging Area:** `git add file1.txt`
    3. **Repository:** `git commit -m "Add file1.txt"`
    4. **Remote Repository:** `git push origin main`



### 7. Viewing the Commit Log

- **Command:** `git log`
- **Explanation:** This command shows the commit history of the current branch. It lists all the commits in reverse chronological order (most recent commits first).
  ```bash
  git log
  ```

### 8. Viewing a Single Commit

- **Command:** `git log -1`
- **Explanation:** This command shows only the most recent commit. It’s useful when you just need to see the latest changes.
  ```bash
  git log -1
  ```

### 9. Viewing a Simplified Commit Log

- **Command:** `git log --oneline`
- **Explanation:** This command shows a condensed version of the commit history. Each commit is displayed on a single line with the commit hash and commit message. It’s handy for getting a quick overview of the commit history.
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```

## Atomic Commits

### 10. Atomic Commits

- **Explanation:** An atomic commit is a commit that contains changes related to a single task or issue. The idea is to keep each commit focused and small, making it easier to understand and manage the history of changes. Each atomic commit should be self-contained, meaning it includes everything necessary for that change to work and nothing more.
  - **Benefits:**
    - **Easier to Understand:** Each commit addresses a specific task or fix, making the commit history easier to read.
    - **Simpler Reverts:** If a commit causes issues, it can be reverted without affecting unrelated changes.
    - **Better Collaboration:** Team members can review and understand changes more easily.

- **Example:** If you are working on adding a new feature and fixing a bug, you should make separate commits for the feature and the bug fix. This way, each commit is focused on a single change.
  ```bash
  # Example of creating atomic commits
  git add feature_file.py
  git commit -m "Add new feature X"

  git add bugfix_file.py
  git commit -m "Fix bug Y"
  ```

### 11. Setting Username and Email

- **Command:** `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets your username for all Git repositories on your computer. It’s essential for identifying who made the changes in the commit history.
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  ```

- **Command:** `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets your email address for all Git repositories on your computer. It’s used in conjunction with your username to attribute commits.
  ```bash
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  ```

### 12. Setting Default Text Editor

- **Command:** `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
- **Explanation:** This command sets Visual Studio Code as the default text editor for Git. The `--wait` option tells Git to wait for the editor to close before proceeding. You can replace `"code --wait"` with your preferred text editor command.
  ```bash
  git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
  ```

## Git Ignore and Configuration Files

### 13. Using .gitignore

- **Explanation:** The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build outputs, or sensitive information from being tracked.
  - **Example:** Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository and add patterns for files you want to ignore.
  ```gitignore
  # Ignore all .log files
  *.log

  # Ignore node_modules directory
  node_modules/

  # Ignore all files in the temp directory
  temp/
  ```

### 14. .gitconfig File

- **Explanation:** The `.gitconfig` file in your root directory (or home directory) stores global Git configuration settings. These settings apply to all repositories on your machine unless overridden by a repository-specific configuration.
  - **Location:** Typically found at `~/.gitconfig` on Unix systems and `C:\Users\YourName\.gitconfig` on Windows.

## Commit Details

### 15. Commit Behind the Scenes

- **Explanation:** Each commit in Git has a unique hash (ID), and it stores information about the commit, including the author, date, commit message, and a pointer to its parent commit.
  - **Diagram:**
    ```plaintext
    +------------------------+
    | Commit Hash: def456    |
    | Parent Hash: ghi789    |
    | Author: Your Name      |
    | Date: YYYY-MM-DD       |
    | Message: "1st commit"  |
    +------------------------+
                |
                v
    +------------------------+
    | Commit Hash: abc123    |
    | Parent Hash: def456    |
    | Author: Your Name      |
    | Date: YYYY-MM-DD       |
    | Message: "@nd commit"  |
    +------------------------+
    ```

### 16. Viewing All Commits

- **Explanation:** All commit messages and details are stored in the `.git` directory within your repository. Specifically, you can see all the commit objects in the `.git/objects` directory, but a more user-friendly way is to use `git log` or look into the `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` file for the most recent commit message.
  - **Commands to View Commits:**
    ```bash
    git log  # View commit history
    cat .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG  # View the message of the most recent commit
    ```
