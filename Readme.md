## Git Commands and Concepts

### 1. Checking Git Version

- **Command:** `git --version`
- **Explanation:** This command checks the version of Git installed on your system. It's useful to ensure you have Git installed and to verify you're using an up-to-date version.
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

### 2. Checking Repository Status

- **Command:** `git status`
- **Explanation:** This command shows the current status of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

### 3. Initializing a Repository

- **Command:** `git init`
- **Explanation:** Run this command one time per folder to turn that folder into a Git repository. This command sets up the necessary files and directories that Git uses to track changes.
  ```bash
  git init
  ```

### 4. The Hidden .git Folder

- **Explanation:** When you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden folder named `.git` inside your project directory. This folder contains all the configuration files and data necessary for version control.
  - **Example:** `.git` is like the brain of your Git repository; it stores all the history and information about your commits and branches.

### 5. Commits: Like Checkpoints

- **Explanation:** A commit in Git is like saving a game. Each commit records a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous commit, just like restarting from the last checkpoint in a game.
  - **Example:** If you save your game at level 5, you can always go back to level 5 if you mess up at level 6.

### 6. Basic Workflow in Git

- **Workflow Overview:**
  1. **Working Directory:** This is your initialized folder where you make changes to files.
  2. **Staging Area:** When you’re ready to save a snapshot of your changes, you add them to the staging area using `git add`.
  3. **Repository:** After staging, you commit your changes to the repository with `git commit`. This saves your snapshot.
  4. **Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub):** Finally, you push your commits from your local repository to a remote repository like GitHub using `git push`.

  - **Illustration:**
    ```
    Working Dir[initialized folder] ---> git add ---> Staging Area ---> git commit ---> Repo ---> git push ---> GitHub
    ```

  - **Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Add changes to the staging area
    git add <file_name>
    git add .  # Adds all changes

    # Commit changes to the repository
    git commit -m "Commit message"

    # Push changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
    git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
    ```

  - **Example Workflow:**
    1. **Working Directory:** Make changes to `file1.txt`.
    2. **Staging Area:** `git add file1.txt`
    3. **Repository:** `git commit -m "Add file1.txt"`
    4. **Remote Repository:** `git push origin main`
